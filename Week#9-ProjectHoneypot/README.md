# Week 9 Project: Honeypot

Time spent: >20 hours spent in total

> Objective: 

MHN supports multiple honeypots, each of which has a slightly different purpose you can read about. To start, we'll deploy Dionaea over HTTP, a honeypot used to trap malware samples.
First, create a VM for your first honeypot via your cloud provider. 

After having established SSH access the new honeypot VM, we need to install the honeypot application into the VM and wire it to connect back to the admin server
