# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 20+ hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration 

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

 - Story: The vulnerabality is exposed through bolding the login fail message. While the red and blue sites doesnt say anything about a correct or incorrect username, the green site bolds the login fail message when the username is correct and normal text message otherwise.

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference
 
 ![](https://github.com/shofi384/CSC.59938---Web-Security/blob/master/Week%238-Pentesting%20Live%20Targets/idor.gif)
 - Story: This vulnarability is exposed through manipulating the url's id value. An IDOR vulnerability exists in the red application, where a user can see any account that are not even available for public. We can use the public/salesperson.php?id=?? endpoint where ?? is the ID of the salesperson. In this example, the id 10 of "Testy McTesterson" is inserted who is not supposed to be shown in public until September. Thus guessing ID numbers until an publicly unavailable object is reached opens up door to attackers. The blue and green applications mitigate this by simply redirecting the user back to the list of salespeople with absolutely no feedback.

Vulnerability #2: Cross Site Request Forgery
 
 ![](https://github.com/shofi384/CSC.59938---Web-Security/blob/master/Week%238-Pentesting%20Live%20Targets/csrf.gif)
 - Story: This vulnarability is exposed through
